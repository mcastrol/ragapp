Rosa is a genus of over three hundred species of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae.
They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.
Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colors ranging from white through yellows and reds.
Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa.
Species, cultivars, and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often fragrant flowers.

Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies. They are often used as symbols of love and beauty.
The rose is the national flower of England, and it is also the state flower of several U.S. states.
In addition to their ornamental use, roses have been valued for their fragrance, which is distilled into rose oil for use in perfumes,
and for their fruit, rose hips, which are used in cooking and to make herbal teas.
